# Keyboard Walk Word List
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for keyboard walk wordlist. This work will try and build upon some of the previous work using trees, and with a terrific implemintation in hashcat using https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor. While MCMC will almost certainly be slower than tree spanning or kwprocessor generation, MCMC can provide an opportunity for providing jumps in keyboard walks and when faced with a problem my first thought is "how can I solve this problem by sampling the hell out of it".
